# Breast-Cancer-Detection_AI_Project

Breast cancer is a dangerous disease for women. If it does not
identify in the early-stage then the result will be the death of the patient. It is
a common cancer in women worldwide. Worldwide near about 12% of
women are affected by breast cancer and the number is still increasing.
We have extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal
person cells. As a Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist has to create
an Artificial Intelligence based Machine Learning model to classify
malignant and benign tumours.
To complete this project, we are using the supervised machine
learning classifier algorithm. We have used different classification
algorithms like Support vector classifier, Random Forest classifier, XGBoost
classifier and picked the best algorithm which gives us more accuracy.
